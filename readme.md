# Automation with Web Driver IO 
This is a fairly simple project to practise my test automation skills using Web Driver IO framework with Mocha, TypeScript and NodeJS

## Goals and Objective
My goal with this little project is not only enchnace my knowledge of test automation but also apply page object model and keep my code DRY, and easy to read and maintain. Also, once finished with tests, I'd love to learn mode about CI/CD and try to deploy this test suite with Jenkins
